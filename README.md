# Thanks to
First of all, I have to thank [ChiliTomatoNoode](https://www.youtube.com/user/ChiliTomatoNoodle) and his [C++ 3D DirectX Programming](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLqCJpWy5Fohd3S7ICFXwUomYW0Wv67pDD) tutorials. A lot of my DirectX/Win32 knowledge came directly from him and I thank him a lot for making those tutorials.

Secondly, I thank a lot of people on Discord servers that helped me with stuff when I got stuck, specially since I had some issues that I would have still been stuck on if I havent had help from those people
